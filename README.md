## Motivation
With Telegram increasingly getting popular and popular social media option in recent years, it has become a target for s(p/c)ammers. Many groups and their members are bombarded by spam and unsolicited messages on daily basis, mostly attributed to the lack of built-in protections systems in place.

This project intends to mitigate these issues by forcing every new member to go through a captcha verification process thus making it harder for automated accounts/userbots to roam free in these groups.

## Getting Started

Git clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TibebeJS/emoji-captcha-bot.git
```

Change directory into the newly created repository ("emoji-captcha-bot")
```bash
cd emoji-captcha-bot.git
```

Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

Open up `config/development/general.json5` file and provide `botToken` and `challenge`
```json5
{
  botToken: "123456:bot token", // REPLACE with your token - from @BotFather
  challenge: "text", // options: ['text', 'audio', 'image']
}
```

### Then edit your challenge specific config file
E.g.  if we choose `'text'` as our challenge, then the config file would be `config/development/text-emoji-captcha.json5`

**Example** (`"text-emoji-captcha.json5"` file)

```json5
{
  challengeEmojisCount: 5, // how many emojis to present in the challenge
  answerEmojisColumns: 3, // number of columns in the answer's keypad
  answerEmojisRows: 3, // number of rows in the answer's keypad
  emojiSeparator: "-", // what's in between consecutive emojis
  numberOfAttempts: 3, // number of attempts before restriction
  numberOfAttempts: 3, // number of attempts before restriction
  emojiBlacklist: [ "üñï", "üçÜ", "üçë" ], // dont show these emojis
  showCountryFlags: true, // show/hide country emojis
}
```

After successful configuration, run the project:
```bash
npm start
```

## How it works

### **Version 1 (Current):**
- Whenever a new member joins a group they will automatically be muted/restricted by the bot.
- Bot then sends a message which contains emojis (presented as text).
- User is prompted with emoji buttons to click on.
- if user successfully manages to select all the emojis that are present in the challenge, his/her restrictions will be lifted automatically by the bot.
- if the user runs out of attempts left before completing the challenge, he/she will remain restricted. 

Sample challenge:
