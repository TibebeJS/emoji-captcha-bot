## Motivation
With Telegram increasingly getting popular and popular social media option in recent years, it has become a target for s(p/c)ammers. Many groups and their members are bombarded by spam and unsolicited messages on daily basis, mostly attributed to the lack of built-in protections systems in place.

This project intends to mitigate these issues by forcing every new member to go through a captcha verification process thus making it harder for automated accounts/userbots to roam free in these groups.

## Getting Started

Git clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TibebeJS/emoji-captcha-bot.git
```

Change directory into the newly created repository ("emoji-captcha-bot")
```console
cd emoji-captcha-bot.git
```

Install dependencies
```console
npm i
```

Create `.env` file (a sample content is provided in `.env.sample`)

Example:
```console
echo "BOT_TOKEN=123456:bottoken" > .env
```

Run the project
```console
npm start
```

## How it works

### **Version 1 (Current):**
- Whenever a new member joins a group they will automatically be muted/restricted by the bot.
- Bot then sends a message which contains emojis (presented as text).
- User is prompted with emoji buttons to click on.
- if user successfully manages to select all the emojis that are present in the challenge, his/her restrictions will be lifted automatically by the bot.
- if the user runs out of attempts left before completing the challenge, he/she will remain restricted. 

Sample challenge:
